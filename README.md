Overview
========

This is a Python client for a Flower Delivery Chatbot that I made using [API.AI](http://www.api.ai). The bot will have a full conversation with the user, from intial proposal to order delivery status. 

## Dependencies
Python 2.7 , api.ai ((https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-python))

## Basic Usage
To run, type the following into terminal

`python demo.py `

The conversation will start! All the chatbot logic happens in the API.AI console You can exit the conversation by just typing 'exit' into the chat.
